This project can generate the horoscope for all 12 zodiac for a selecting year. After selecting a year a random score will be generated for all days of the year and 
obviously for all zodiac at a time. Then a full calendar will be shown with all zodiac as a button group and there the most lucky zodiac will be marked. And then the user have to select their own zodiac for getting their calendar according to selected zodiac. <br>

The days will be colored according to score from 1 to 10 and above the calendar the user will able to know the most lucky month according to average point for that specific zodiac.

Every time the user will generate the horoscope for a year,the database will be updated because the programmer believe that every person has their own luck and the most interesting part is people's luck changes every moment.
